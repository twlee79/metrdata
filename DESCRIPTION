Description: The goal of metrdata is to provide a simply interface for 
  associating arbitrary metadata with data in R. These metadata can, for example, 
  be used to describe the source of the data, any processing steps taken, and 
  parameters used to process the data. The metadata are saved and read alongside 
  the data files, and can be easily inherited in derived data.
